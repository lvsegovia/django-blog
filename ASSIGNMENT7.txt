Description

For your homework this week, we’ll fix one glaring problem with our blog admin.
As you created new categories and posts, and related them to each-other, how did you feel about that work?

Although from a data perspective, the category model is the right place for the
ManytoMany relationship to posts, this leads to awkward usage in the admin.
It would be much easier if we could designate a category for a post from the Post admin.
Your Assignment

You’ll be reversing that relationship so that you can only add categories to posts

Take the following steps:

    Read the documentation again about the  Django admin.

    You’ll need to create a customized  ModelAdmin  class for the  Post  and  Category  models.

    And you’ll need to create an  InlineModelAdmin  to represent Categories on the Post admin view.

    Finally, you’ll need to  exclude  the ‘posts’ field from the form in your  Category  admin.

    All told, those changes should not require more than about 15 total lines of code.
    The trick, of course, is reading and finding out which fifteen lines to write.
